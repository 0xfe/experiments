
NCSA Portfolio

Portfolio is a very useful collection of model loaders, 
developed by the now-defunct NCSA Java 3D Group, in a 
project led by Steve Pietrowicz (srp@ncsa.uiuc.edu) and 
Chris Heistad (chris@heistad.org).

Neither of those people is working on NCSA Portfolio now.

Portfolio is used in chapters 16, 18, 19, 24, 27, and 32 
of the book:
  Killer Game Programming in Java
